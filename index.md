## Raquel Centeno
### Public Opinion, Political Behavior, Identity Politics

**Hi, my name is Raquel Centeno.** I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Southern California studying how voters think and feel about parties and partisanship. I also explore how these feelings are impacted by voters' various group identities, particularly race and racial identity. My subfields are American politics and Methods, and I am especially interested in subjects related to **public opinion** and **political psychology**.

My dissertation focuses on the concept of **affective partisan polarization** and the role that **racial and ethnic identity** plays in how voters feel about their **partisanship** and other partisans. I have also worked on research that involves voting behavior, electoral systems, and emotions & politics. I tend to work with quantitative methods with a particular focus on **surveys**, **experiments**, and integrating computational social science methods into survey work. I am fortunate to be the recipient of multiple grants for my research in this area and am a 2022-2023 APSA Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behavior (EPOVB) Fellow.

Prior to USC, I completed my BA in Political Science at California Lutheran University in 2018. I have also been an instructor in American politics at Occidental College. Outside of academic work I have also served as a Research Associate at The Center for Election Science where I was able to apply my survey and experimental research skills to understanding how voters think about electoral systems and ballot initiatives.

When I'm not doing academic work, I enjoy doing fitness classes a few times a week, playing video games on my Nintendo Switch, going to farmer's markets, and spending time with my cat Xochi.

If you are someone interested in political science as a field, wondering what graduate school is like, or even thinking about USC as a grad school option, feel free to reach out to me via email! I'm always happy to chat.
