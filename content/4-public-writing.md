#### [2021: A voting rights analysis of high-Latino-CVAP proposed districts in south and east L.A. County: Are proposed districts in L.A. County and the southern California area Latino-ability-to-elect districts? (with Christian Grose)] ( https://tinyurl.com/mjfyyze8)

I assisted Prof. Christian Grose in conducting a racially-polarized voting analysis of proposed high-Latino Congressional voting districts in south and east Los Angeles County. In doing so, we found that evidence of racial polarization in parts of L.A. County which indicated a need for an additional Latino ability-to-elect district. Through reconfiguration of proposed districts, we determined that such a district could be added to L.A. County without diluting the influence of Latino voters in other districts. This analysis was ultimately distributed by Hispanas Organized for Political Equality (HOPE).
