My research agenda, broadly speaking, is centered around the areas of public opinion, political psychology, and political behavior. Much of my research is grounded in questions of how individuals' various group identities influence how they form their views on (and beliefs about) politics. While I am interested in multiple types of group identities, my research these days tends to focus on racial and partisan identities. I am especially interested in how individuals navigate the intersection of these two identity areas at a time of growing partisan animosity and racial sorting into parties. Methodologically, I am especially interested in survey and experimental methods which make up the bulk of my work. I also dabble a bit in some projects with computational social science techniques like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis.

##### The Racial Undercurrents of Affective Partisan Polarization

My dissertation studies affective partisan polarization among white and Latino partisans, with a particular focus on how racial identities interact with partisan identities. At a time of both increasing partisan animosity and divergences in how the parties tackle race issues, I examine how a partisan's racial group membership impacts how they perceive the in- and out-parties. I advance a theory that white and Latino partisans conceptualize the parties differently conditional on their partisanship and racial group closeness, and that because of these connections between race and partisanship, their partisan sentiment is connected to individual perceptions of racial discrimination and threat. Through the use of original closed- and open-ended survey data, I argue in an upcoming project that whites and Latinos think about the parties and their partisans differently and that race is an important component of these differences. I also use survey data and survey experiments to demonstrate that perceived racial threat and marginalization can shift partisan affect. These findings suggests that the link between race and partisanship is important to understanding the modern issue of partisan polarization. My dissertation demonstrates that while partisan polarization might feel like a new problem, aspects of it are intertwined with and fueled by the longer-standing racial conflicts that are a defining feature of American politics. Part of what has driven the increases in affective polarization today are the racial undercurrents that bleed into other political conflicts that do not seem race-related on their face. Ultimately, I argue that the partisan conflicts observable today are in many ways interwoven with other historical identity-based conflicts at the heart of American politics.
