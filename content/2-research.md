My research agenda, broadly speaking, is centered around the areas of public opinion, political psychology, and political behavior. Much of my research is grounded in questions of how individuals' various group identities influence how they form their views on (and beliefs about) politics. While I am interested in multiple types of group identities, my research these days tends to focus on racial and partisan identities. I am especially interested in how individuals navigate the intersection of these two identity areas at a time of growing partisan animosity and racial sorting into parties. Methodologically, I am especially interested in survey and experimental methods which make up the bulk of my work. I also dabble a bit in some projects with computational social science techniques like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis.

##### The Racial Undercurrents of Affective Partisan Polarization

My dissertation studies affective partisan polarization among white and Latino partisans, with a particular focus on how racial identities interact with partisan identities. At a time of both increasing partisan animosity and divergences in how the parties tackle race issues, I examine how a partisan's racial group membership impacts how they perceive the in- and out-parties. I advance a theory that white and Latino partisans conceptualize the parties differently conditional on their partisanship and racial group closeness, and that because of these connections between race and partisanship, their partisan sentiment is connected to individual perceptions of racial discrimination and threat. Through the use of original closed- and open-ended survey data, I argue in an upcoming project that whites and Latinos think about the parties and their partisans differently and that race is an important component of these differences. I also use survey data and survey experiments to demonstrate that perceived racial threat and marginalization can shift partisan affect. These findings suggests that the link between race and partisanship is important to understanding the modern issue of partisan polarization. My dissertation demonstrates that while partisan polarization might feel like a new problem, aspects of it are intertwined with and fueled by the longer-standing racial conflicts that are a defining feature of American politics. Part of what has driven the increases in affective polarization today are the racial undercurrents that bleed into other political conflicts that do not seem race-related on their face. Ultimately, I argue that the partisan conflicts observable today are in many ways interwoven with other historical identity-based conflicts at the heart of American politics.

###### [The Demobilizing Effect of Primary Electoral Institutions on Voters of Color](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3831739) (R&R at Political Research Quarterly)

Are electoral institutions – such as closed primaries – associated with reduced levels of participation by people of color? We theorize and find that primary electoral institutions that bar independent voters from participating in first-round elections mechanically reduce participation in primary elections; and also reduce turnout among registered independents in second-round general elections. Closed primaries have large demobilizing impacts on Asian American and Latinx voters, as these voters are registered as independents at higher rates than whites. We examine nationally representative and validated survey data from 2012 to 2018. Open and top-two primaries are associated with higher turnout from independent voters of color in both primary and general elections. Implications are that party registration status and formal institutions differentially demobilize voters of color and whites. 

###### Elite Hostile Relations Change Out-Party Sentiment among Black but Not White Partisans: Two Experiments

What is the impact of hostile elite partisan relations on out-party attitudes among the mass public? Does the effect of hostile partisan relations on out-party sentiment differ by race? Extant research on affective polarization looks at the impact of hostile elite relations on predominately white samples and does not as directly connect group identities to affective polarization by focusing on how race influences partisan affect. I conduct two survey experimental studies: one study of white partisans and one study of Black partisans. I argue that hostile elite relations will have differing effects on Black and white partisans when the race of elites in conflict is varied. Like previous work, I find that hostile elite relations have more subdued effects on white partisans. However, hostile elite relations change Black attitudes toward the out-party. Surprisingly, when elite partisans argue with one another, Black respondents become warmer toward the out-party. Further, white partisans reduce support for the out-party when Black in-party elites argue with Black out-party elites. These results suggest researchers studying affective polarization should consider how identities such as race affect how voters appraise partisan conflict.

###### When Party and Race Align: Perceived Racial Discrimination’s Relationship with Affective Polarization

What is the relationship between perceived racial discrimination and affective polarization? I argue that findings from extant research regarding race, partisanship, and racial discrimination suggest that perceived discrimination should also play a role in partisan affect. To evaluate the role of perceived racial discrimination in affective polarization, I use survey data from both an original nationally representative sample and 2012 – 2020 ANES data to determine how perceived racial discrimination correlates with partisan affect. I find mixed evidence that perceived discrimination on its own is associated with affective distance at the aggregate level. However, disaggregating the sample into Black, Latino, and white groups reveals the role of party messaging on race in conditioning perceived racial discrimination’s effects on partisan sentiment. These findings indicate that affective polarization is at its strongest when a voter perceives a conflict that intersects with both their partisan and racial group identities. These results suggest that researchers should consider the potential influences of race and racial politics in their study of affective polarization. Additionally worth considering is how party ideologies and messaging on race might interact with non-partisan group identities to produce more extreme partisan responses.
