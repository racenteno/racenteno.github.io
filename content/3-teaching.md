On this page you can find detailed information about the courses for which I have served as either instructor of record or as a teaching assistant. Syllabi are available upon request. 

### Instructor of Record

#### American Politics and Public Policy (Occidental College)

An introductory course for Occidental College students interested in American politics and aspects of public policy typically taken by first and second year students in a variety of majors. This course provides a survey of American politics and cover a variety of what makes up the United States political ecosystem. Beyond just covering current events and basic facts about the government, this course encourages students to think deeply about the hows and whys of American political institutions and behavior. The ultimate goal of this course is for students to walk away with an enhanced knowledge of how the systems that structure U.S. politics work, as well as an ability to develop unique critical assessments about the state of American politics.

### Teaching Assistant

#### Law, Politics, and Public Policy (Taught by Prof. Jeb Barnes, University of Southern California)

This course examines the role of law and courts in society; the American justice system; and the complex relationship between law, politics, and public policy in the United States.  As developed more fully below, we will explore a wide range of questions, including the following:  What is the promise of law in society?  What are its limits?  How does our legal system compare with those in other industrialized democracies?  What are relative advantages and disadvantages of our system?  To what extent (and under what conditions) does it provide fair and efficient dispute resolution, make prudent and effective policy, and promote democratic values? We will explore these questions through a variety of disciplinary lenses and case studies, some contemporary and some historical.  The goal of the case studies will be to explore the underlying theoretical debates and sharpen your analytic skills in preparation for the final paper.
